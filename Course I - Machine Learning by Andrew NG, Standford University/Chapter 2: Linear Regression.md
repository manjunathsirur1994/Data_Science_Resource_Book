## What is Linear Regression?


Linear Regression is a predictive algorithm which provides a Linear relationship between Prediction (Call it ‘Y’) and Input (Call is ‘X’).

As we know from the basic maths that if we plot an ‘X’,’Y’ graph, a linear relationship will always come up with a straight line. For example, if we plot the graph of these values

(Input) X = 1,2,3,4,5
(Prediction) Y = 1,2,3,4,5

It will be a perfectly straight line

Before moving further into this, let’s understand the fact that in real life, we don’t get such a perfect relationship between Inputs and Predictions and that’s why we need machine learning algorithms


Equation of Straight Line from 2 Points
The equation of a straight line is written using the y = mx + b, where m is the slope (Gradient) and b is y-intercept (where the line crosses the Y axis).

Once we get the equation of a straight line from 2 points in space in y = mx + b format, we can use the same equation to predict the points at different values of x which result in a straight line.

In this formula, m is the slope and b is y-intercept.

Linear regression is a way to predict the 'Y' values for unknown values of Input 'X' like 1.5, 0.4, 3.6, 5.7 and even for -1, -5, 10 etc.
